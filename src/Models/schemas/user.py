class UserRegister(ORMModel):
    """
    Data Transfer Object (DTO) for user registration requests.

    This model serves as the initial validation layer at the system boundary.
    It enforces structural integrity and basic format constraints before data
    enters the domain layer.

    Architectural Role:
        - **Input Validation**: Ensures strict adherence to field constraints (length, patterns).
        - **Security Boundary**: Prevents malformed or excessively large payloads from
        reaching the service layer, mitigating basic injection or buffer overflow vectors.
        - **Role Enforcement**: Restricts user creation to specific authorized roles
        ('admin' or 'instructor') via regex pattern matching.

    Attributes:
        full_name (str): The user's legal or display name. Constrained to 2-100 characters
                        to prevent empty strings or database truncation issues.
        email (EmailStr): Validated email address serving as the unique identifier for login.
        password (str): Raw password input. Min length 6 supports local/dev testing; max length 128
                        accommodates standard hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) while preventing
                        DoS attacks via massive string hashing.
        role (str): The target authorization role. Strictly validated against "admin" or "instructor"
                    to prevent privilege escalation attacks via invalid role injection.

class UserLogin(ORMModel):

    DTO for user authentication credentials.

    This model captures the minimum necessary information to establish identity.

    Architectural Role:
        - **Credential Isolation**: Separates authentication data from registration data.
        - **Input Sanitization**: Basic length checks on the password field serve as a
        preliminary filter before computationally expensive hashing operations.

    Attributes:
        email (EmailStr): The user's identity claim.

    """
    Outbound DTO representing a sanitized user entity.

    This model defines the public contract for user data, strictly decoupling the
    internal persistence schema (SQLAlchemy model) from the external API representation.

    Architectural Role:
        - **Information Hiding**: Explicitly excludes sensitive fields (password hashes, salts,
        internal flags) present in the database model.
        - **Serialization**: Standardizes the JSON structure for user resources across the API.
        - **Audit Trail**: Inherits `TimestampedResponse` to expose `created_at` and `updated_at`
        metadata, essential for client-side caching and data freshness logic.

    Attributes:
        full_name (str): The user's display name.
        email (EmailStr): The user's contact/login email.
        role (str): The assigned authorization scope (e.g., 'admin', 'instructor').

class Token(ORMModel):
    """
    Schema for OAuth2-compliant authentication tokens.

    Represents the artifacts required for stateless session management in a distributed system.

    Architectural Role:
        - **Session State**: Encapsulates the 'access' (short-lived) and 'refresh' (long-lived)
        credentials, allowing the client to maintain a session without re-sending credentials.
        - **Standard Compliance**: Adheres to RFC 6749 (OAuth 2.0) structure for compatibility
        with standard HTTP Authorization headers (Bearer scheme).

    Attributes:
        access_token (str): JWT signed with the secret key, containing claims for authorization.
                            Used for authenticating requests to protected resources.
        refresh_token (str): Long-lived token used solely to acquire new access tokens.
                            Enables rotation policies and secure session extension.
        token_type (str): The authorization scheme, defaults to "bearer".

class TokenPayload(ORMModel):
    """
    Internal representation of decoded JWT claims.

    This model serves as the trusted identity context within the application after

    Architectural Role:

        the current user's identity (Subject) and permissions (Role).
        - **Type Safety**: Converts loosely typed JSON claims into a structured Python object,
        preventing key errors and logical bugs in authorization checks.

        role (str): The user's RBAC role extracted from the token.
        type (str): Token type claim (e.g., "access", "refresh") to prevent token misuse
